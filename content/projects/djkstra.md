## Description

Created a versatile Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform featuring 5 services: conversation, music, image, video generation, and code generation. Introduced a trial period allowing users to experience these services up to 5 times. Seamlessly integrated a payment model through Stripe for convenient transactions post the trial period.
