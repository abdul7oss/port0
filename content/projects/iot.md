<!-- - There are two methods for commanding the robotic arm to do a specific task. A microcontroller is a popular method. A Robotic Arm with a microcontroller provides programmability. This method, however, is slightly slower since it must do memory read/write operations in order to execute the instructions. Another option is to create a custom ASIC package that implements the Robotic Arm task algorithm. High speed is provided by a custom ASIC package. Nonetheless, low scale production is expensive, and the chip takes time to make. The usage of an FPGA to create the Robotic Arm controller is a middle path. FPGA provides programmability and is a fast technique to get the prototype ready. It is also the technique of choice for low-volume applications.

- This project employs an FPGA method. I prototyped with a Nexys4DDR board outfitted with a Xilinx Artix-7 series FPGA. Furthermore, SG90 servo motors are employed to control the Robotic Arm. The FPGA was programmed using Verilog HDL. The Xilinx Vivado tool was used for simulation and FPGA implementation of the design. I created a prototype of a 3-DOF Robotic Arm controller (Degree of Freedom). The proposed arm is intended to perform a specific action both manually and automatically. -->
