## Description

This project was completed as part of the HACKINTELLIGENCE HACKATHONÂ for Innovation.

Our face mask detector makes no use of modified masked photos, and the model is accurate. It is computationally efficient due to the usage of MobileNetV2 architecture, making it easy to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).


As a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, this system can be employed in real-time applications that require face-mask detection for safety purposes. This project can be combined with embedded systems and used to ensure that public safety requirements are followed in airports, train stations, offices, schools, and public areas.
