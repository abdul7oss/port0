- Built an e-commerce marketplace for purchasing vehicles using Node.js, React, Redux, and MongoDB, where
authenticated users can view and interact with 3D models of vehicles, customize vehicles and place purchase orders.
- The website also features an admin portal to track and accept orders and a user portal to view and track their orders.
Payment was implemented using RazorPay API and 3D models were displayed using ThreeJS.
