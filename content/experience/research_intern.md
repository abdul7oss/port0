## Description



I worked as a remote intern at [**Onward Assist**](https://onwardassist.ai/), where the company envisions  to assist pathologists in betterÂ cancer diagnosis using the latest image analysis and computational power.

Here, I developed a configuration-driven framework with data preprocessing pipeline to train deep learning models on **AWS EC2** instances. The framework standardized the training procedure for ML models and **saved more than 100 hours of development time for the ML team**. I also worked on malignant head and neck segmentation using this framework. 

This opportunity provided me with a deeper insight into the applications of AI and Computer Vision in medical diagnosis and taught me to work with little and sensitive data. In addition, **Confluence** was used for documentation and **Jira Software** was used for **Agile Software Development**.
