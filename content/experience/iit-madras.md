## Description
**Guide:** **Prof. Mohammed Abdul Qadeer** (Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer Engineering, AMU)

My work focused on developing **efficient deep-learning model** (an **Efficient Net B3 based** architecture) to detect **Covid19, Pneumonia** from **Chest CT scans**, a **Disease Diagnosis** problem. However, a major challenge that I faced was the lack of computational resources for training deep neural networks, arising from the sheer amount of data that is there. Consequently, the motivation behind the project was to develop computationally efficient solutions. Additionally, the model achieved F1-score of 0.9. Moreover, this work also got published in 6th International Conference on
Inventive Systems and Control
ICISC 2022.
