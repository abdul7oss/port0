### Description
**Guide:** **Prof. Vivek Kanhangad** (Associate Professor, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Indore)

- Performed Fingerprint Domain Adaptation via image to image translation using cycleGANs. Created
mapping between two different fingerprint domains such that low quality fingerprint images converted
into high quality ones for improving cross sensor fingerprint recognition.
- Implemented U-Net-based CycleGAN and ResNet-based CycleGAN with 9 residual blocks. ResNet based
CycleGAN improved fingerprint recognition accuracy by 9%. 
<!-- - Developed a **Salesforce app** using SFDX to provide clients with a customized experience within their Salesforce dashboard.
- Developed a **Slack bot** to send interactive daily notifications to customers, and to allow them to take actions directly from Slack. This eliminated the operational resistance and **increased the adoption of our product by over 50%**.
- Implemented authorization for Slack integration with BuyerAssist using **React** and **OAuth 2.0**
- Mentored a new recruit for a period of 1 month -->
